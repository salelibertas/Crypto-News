          <p>Popular cryptocurrency analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe has revealed he sees Cardano’s $ADA move up in the near future after it traded around a significant support zone for some time.

            The analyst’s words come after the entire cryptocurrency market endured a steep correction that saw its market capitalization drop by around $200 billion and the price of $ADA drop to around $1.5, its lowest level since August.
            
            The crypto market correction saw ADA’s price hit a key area outlined by van de Poppe, who pointed out on November 25 he would be “very happy” to buy ADA once it fell to two outlined areas in an ADA/BTC chart. These pointed to $1.54 and $1.75.</p>
          <p><mark>About Verlux</mark></p>
          <p>Verlux NFT Platform is a new NFT Marketplace based on the Cardano blockchain. Unlike existing NFT marketplaces on Cardano now which operate using a sign-up /  login modal, Verlux will tow the path of decentralization by utilizing the connect wallet feature.
            Digital creators, Meme makers & artists can utilize the Verlux NFT marketplace to mint their digital works as Non-fungible tokens that would be authentic as the data could be verified on the blockchain in a quick, and easy manner.</p>

          <p><mark>Mission</mark></p>
          <p>Verlux is on a mission to become the leading NFT marketplace on the Cardano blockchain and later evolve to a multi-chain digital marketplace where NFTs existing on other blockchains can be inter-tradable on a single interface.
            Listing your NFTs on Verlux will be super easy as you would just need to connect a compatible Cardano web-based wallet like Nami & Gero wallet, then click on Mint NFT and you will see a simple form to list your NFT, and you are set!</p>

          <p>Over the course of the last ten years, many altcoins came and went, while some struggled to carry forward. Litecoin, however, has managed to remain relevant in the market despite the occasional speed breakers and rangebound price action. In fact, LTC rallied over 50% in early November only to succumb to the Bitcoin and larger market sell-offs. 
            With LTC’s trajectory coming to a pause many in the space are worried if the digital silver would make a return in the market or yet again continue the rangebound momentum it had after the price fall in May. </p>

          <p><b>Bullish momentum can gain strength if…</b></p>
          <p>LTC’s price after making a multi-week high of $302 on November 10, started following BTC’s trajectory more or less flowing in the direction of the larger market. While LTC’s price fell from the $300 level charting over 25% losses at the time of writing, it was crucial for the coin to maintain above the $200 mark, which it succeeded in doing. </p>
          <p>LTC oscillated at $213.83 noting 2.54% daily gains, a move above $220 could further push the coin’s rally. There seemed to be a spike in buying pressure that could kick-start a rally, however, for LTC’s price to rally further a more constant uptrend would be key. </p>
